    bio: [
      "Robert leads software development, regulatory strategy, and research coordination. After being diagnosed with Burkitt's Lymphoma at 19, he graduated from the University of Manchester with a BSc in Computer Science and built his career in FinTech at the London Stock Exchange Group and FlexTrade, where he specialised in building and testing high-frequency algorithmic trading platforms.",
      "Drawing on this technical background, Robert developed the initial concept for Haem.io's novel hybrid AI framework that combines AI-driven data extraction with a deterministic logic engine. He brought this concept to Dr. John Burthem, and together with Dr. Luke Carter-Brzezinski and the technical team, they developed the platform into the production-grade system it is today. Robert manages the project's intellectual property portfolio and oversees the regulatory pathway to UKCA/CE marking as a Class I clinical decision support device."

      "Dr. Clarke leads the technical architecture and data science strategy for Haem.io. He holds both a Master's degree and a PhD in Physics from the University of Manchester, where his research at CERN focused on analysing complex data from large-scale international experiments.",
      "Following his PhD, Dr. Clarke joined the UK Civil Service as a statistician, where he applied AI and data science to support high-frequency government decision-making. He has extensive experience in building scalable, production-ready solutions on cloud platforms to extract actionable insights from complex datasets.",
      "A long-time friend of Robert, he was a key early contributor to the development of Haem.io's LLM and data extraction strategy, bringing a first-principles approach to building secure and robust systems."

      "He leads the Regional Diagnostic Service for Haematological Malignancies in Manchester, one of the UK's foremost specialist centres. With over 50 peer-reviewed publications, he is a nationally recognised expert in the field.",
      "Dr. Burthem has extensive experience in managing large research projects and IT-based partnerships, including work with UK NEQAS, where he leads the digital Special Advisory Group. As a co-inventor of Haem.io's clinical logic, his deep domain expertise and extensive national network are foundational to the project's clinical validation and dissemination strategy."
