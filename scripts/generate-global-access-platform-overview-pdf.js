    <h1>Haem.io Global Access Initiative</h1>
    <h2>Platform Overview</h2>
    <p>Technical overview of the Haem.io diagnostic platform for LME healthcare settings</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>
      The Haem.io platform is an AI-powered diagnostic system designed to provide world-class blood cancer 
      diagnosis in resource-constrained settings. The platform uses advanced artificial intelligence and 
      large language models to extract and classify diagnostic information from standard pathology reports 
      and images, requiring no specialized equipment or complex IT infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document provides a comprehensive technical overview of the platform, including AI extraction 
      capabilities, classification systems, regulatory pathway, and how the platform is specifically 
      adapted for use in lower and middle-income countries.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="page-break"></div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Platform Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      The Haem.io platform is built on a cloud-based architecture that can be accessed from any device 
      with internet connectivity. This design ensures accessibility in diverse healthcare settings, from 
      well-equipped urban hospitals to remote clinics.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Core Components</h3>
    
    <div class="tech-feature">
      <h4>1. AI-Powered Data Extraction</h4>
      <p>
        Our platform uses advanced large language models (LLMs) to extract structured diagnostic information 
        from unstructured pathology reports. This technology can process reports in multiple formats and 
        languages, making it adaptable to different healthcare systems and documentation standards.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Extracts key diagnostic parameters from free-text reports</li>
        <li>Identifies relevant clinical findings and test results</li>
        <li>Structures data for classification algorithms</li>
        <li>Handles variations in report formatting and terminology</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="tech-feature">
      <h4>2. Image Analysis & Processing</h4>
      <p>
        The platform can analyze pathology images (blood smears, bone marrow aspirates) using computer 
        vision algorithms. This capability allows the platform to work with standard microscopy images 
        that hospitals already produce, requiring no new imaging equipment.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Processes standard microscopy images</li>
        <li>Identifies and classifies cell types</li>
        <li>Detects morphological abnormalities</li>
        <li>Works with images from standard cameras or scanners</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="tech-feature">
      <h4>3. Diagnostic Classification System</h4>
      <p>
        Our classification system uses validated algorithms based on WHO and ICC (International Consensus 
        Classification) standards for myeloid malignancies. The system provides diagnostic classifications 
        with confidence scores and supporting evidence.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>WHO 2022 classification standards</li>
        <li>ICC 2022 classification standards</li>
        <li>Multi-class classification for different blood cancer types</li>
        <li>Confidence scoring for diagnostic recommendations</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="tech-feature">
      <h4>4. Decision Support Tools</h4>
      <p>
        Beyond diagnosis, the platform provides decision support tools that help clinicians make informed 
        treatment decisions, even in settings where specialist expertise may be limited.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Treatment response monitoring</li>
        <li>Treatment options calculator</li>
        <li>Risk stratification tools</li>
        <li>Clinical guideline recommendations</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
      The platform workflow is designed to be simple and intuitive, requiring minimal training for 
      healthcare providers:
    </p>
    
    <div class="workflow-step">
      <span class="workflow-step-number">1</span>
      <strong>Data Input:</strong> Healthcare providers upload pathology reports and/or images through 
      a web-based interface. The platform accepts multiple file formats (PDF, images, text files).
    </div>
    
    <div class="workflow-step">
      <span class="workflow-step-number">2</span>
      <strong>AI Extraction:</strong> The platform's AI systems extract structured diagnostic information 
      from the uploaded documents, identifying key findings, test results, and clinical parameters.
    </div>
    
    <div class="workflow-step">
      <span class="workflow-step-number">3</span>
      <strong>Classification:</strong> Using validated classification algorithms, the platform provides 
      diagnostic classifications based on WHO and ICC standards, with confidence scores and supporting 
      evidence.
    </div>
    
    <div class="workflow-step">
      <span class="workflow-step-number">4</span>
      <strong>Results & Recommendations:</strong> Results are presented in a clear, actionable format 
      with diagnostic classifications, confidence scores, and treatment recommendations where appropriate.
    </div>
    
    <div class="workflow-step">
      <span class="workflow-step-number">5</span>
      <strong>Clinical Review:</strong> Local clinicians review results and make final diagnostic and 
      treatment decisions, supported by the platform's recommendations and evidence.
    </div>
  </div>
