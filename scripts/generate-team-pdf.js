      "Robert leads software development, regulatory strategy, and research coordination. After being diagnosed with Burkitt's Lymphoma at 19, he graduated from the University of Manchester with a BSc in Computer Science and built his career in FinTech at the London Stock Exchange Group and FlexTrade, where he specialised in building and testing high-frequency algorithmic trading platforms.",
      "Drawing on this technical background, Robert developed the initial concept for Haem.io's novel hybrid AI framework that combines AI-driven data extraction with a deterministic logic engine. He brought this concept to Dr. John Burthem, and together with Dr. Luke Carter-Brzezinski and the technical team, they developed the platform into the production-grade system it is today. Robert manages the project's intellectual property portfolio and oversees the regulatory pathway to UKCA/CE marking as a Class I clinical decision support device."

      "Following his PhD, Dr. Clarke joined the UK Civil Service as a statistician, where he applied AI and data science to support high-frequency government decision-making. He has extensive experience in building scalable, production-ready solutions on cloud platforms to extract actionable insights from complex datasets. A long-time friend of Robert, he was a key early contributor to the development of Haem.io's LLM and data extraction strategy, bringing a first-principles approach to building secure and robust systems."
